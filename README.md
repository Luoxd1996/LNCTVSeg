Patient-specific and adaptive delineation of lymph node clinical target volumes for nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiotherapy using deep learning.
* This work aims to use deep learning for patient-specific and adaptive delineation of lymph node clinical target volume in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) radiotherapy (RT).
* We will release the development set images and corresponding labels (with anonymization and de-identify the face of patients), comprising 300 CT volumes from 150 patients, after undergoing an anonymous review process.
* We have provided an example from the development cohort dataset, the details are as follows:

|Variable|label index|LN levels included|	Clinical significance in NPC RT|
|---|---|---|---|
|R_II+III+Va|	1	|Right levels II, III, and Va|	Right upper neck|
|L_II+III+Va|	2	|Left levels II,III, and Va	|Left upper neck|
|R_IV+Vb|	3	|Right levels IV and Vb|	Right lower neck|
|L_IV+Vb|	4	|Left levels IV and Vb	|Left lower neck|
|R_Ib|	5	|Right level Ib	|Right submandibular area|
|L_Ib|	6	|Left level Ib	|Left submandibular area|
